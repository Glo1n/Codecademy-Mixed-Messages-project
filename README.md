# Codecademy mixed messages project

The assigment was to make a random generator that outputs three different strings in Javascript. I made a kiss, marry and kill generator and styled it with HTML and CSS in a webpage. The assigment was to make a script only, but I wanted to practise how to implement it in a webpage.
